Question : First find the countries with maximum Win percentage and them based on that how many times they have won in thier home Ground year by Year

team1<-(aggregate(odi$Team1, list(odi$Team1),length)) //How many country as team 1
team2<-(aggregate(odi$Team2, list(odi$Team2),length))
names(team2)[2]<-"Team2Played"
names(team1)[2]<-"Team1Played"
totplayed<-merge(team1,team2,by="Group.1",all=TRUE) //merge to get tottal matches played
allPlay<-cbind(totplayed,(totplayed$Team1Played+totplayed$Team2Played))
names(allPlay)[4]<- "TotMatches" //U have total matches played by a country
 win<-(aggregate(odi$Winner, list(odi$Winner),length)) //matches won by each country
 names(win)[2]<-"Won"
finalPlayed<-merge(allPlay,win,by="Group.1") //Merge win and total matches played
finalPercentage<-cbind(finalPlayed,(finalPlayed$Won/finalPlayed$TotMatches)*100) //get percentage
 names(finalPercentage)[6]<-"Percentage" // change col name to percentage
 finalPercentage<-finalPercentage[order(-finalPercentage$Percentage) , ] //sort percentage 
 topfive<-finalPercentage[1:5,] //From final percentage pick the top five countries
