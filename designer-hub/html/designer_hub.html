            <h1>- What is a Design ?</h1>

                <p>Web design is the process of planning and creating a website. Text, images, digital media and interactive elements are used by web designers to produce the page seen on the web browser.</p>
              </br> 
			  
			  <h1>- Why should Developers learn Design?</h1>

                <p> Well whether  a designer or developer, the end goal is to create a spectacular user experience.The user dose not care about who created the database or who wrote the title page. We need to understand that all they want is a easily usable interface. Besides that many a times we face issues in our firms, wherein designer is not available or is busy in other errands. These impediments delay our work.
                  So developers time to get self sufficient!! No more waiting and head banging over nearing deadline....It is not rocket science and practise does make everything perfect! Try it, it does accelerate your creativity!</p> 
              </br>  
			  
			  <h1>- Understanding Design as a Career</h1>
                <p>  The concept of 'Web design' is fairly easy to define, the term 'Web designer' is a little more nebulous. This month, I'm going to look at some of the many areas encompassed by the general term 'Web designer' just to show how diverse it actually is. If the headings are a bit provocative, don't worry â€“ just read on.</p>

		    <h1>- What do we have for you </h1>
                <p>All about Design: Here we are with a mission to make designing a backhand task for all.
